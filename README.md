# Ryuko Matoi for Minecraft Bedrock Addon
Ryuko Matoi for Minecraft Bedrock
What is there to say?
I was just bored in the summer, and thought i'd make this for funsies
it's my first minecraft addon really, aside from a few experiments
i'm glad it got this far, cause i really didn't expect it to work at all
This will be awkward to explaion to my IRL friends though
