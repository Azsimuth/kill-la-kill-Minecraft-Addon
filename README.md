# Disclaimers:

Please don't hurt me, i'm just a teen with no money, with a passion for doing things.


# Ryuko Matoi for Minecraft Bedrock
What is there to say?
I was just bored in the summer, and thought i'd make this for funsies
it's my first minecraft addon really, aside from a few experiments
i'm glad it got this far, cause i really didn't expect it to work at all
This will be awkward to explaion to my IRL friends though

2022 July 4th:	
Things are going well.
It's coming along slowly.
i added life fiber blocks, and a way to spawn matoi in survival
you need lotta strings for it.
